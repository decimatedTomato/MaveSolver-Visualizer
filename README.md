# ABOUT

I wanted to learn how to use html and typescript in case I need to do some web development down the line.
For content to put on the webpage for now I will do something I've been wanting to make for a while, a maze solving algorithm visualizer.

I have seen people do this in the past on youtube:

actually quite a few so I won't list more.

## DONE

- Ability to generate random maze
- Multiple maze solving algorithms
- Visualize steps of solution

## TODO

- Add A* and djiikstra's algorithms
- Make it so that generated maze is guaranteed to be solvable
- Add sliders/numberfields to control maze size
- Add ability to press on tile to change between wall and path
- Add ability to click and drag around start and end tiles
- Add audio elements
- Add speed of visualization slider
- Add color legend
